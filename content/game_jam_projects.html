        <h3>Adventures of Captain Cleaner - Ludum Dare 2018</h3>
        <p>This is a Game about a Super Smart Cleaner Software (oh sorry! It's not a SOFTWARE, it's a Super Hero). He ventures on his journey to slay all the trash from the computers to make SPACE for his city to function peacefully.
        I am credited as @nonlinearguy. I was part of a team of 4, all sleep-deprived and high on chai. We had 72 hours to finish the game. We used Unity game engine.
        </p>

        <p>It's a 2D platformer where the player’s main objective is to swap between your hard drives and clean all the unwanted trash by tricking them into the Uninstalling center, while they are following you. Like the Pied Piper of Hamelin.</p>
